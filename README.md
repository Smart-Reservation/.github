Web3 Smart Reservation Service

Project Name: Track Book
Track Book is a decentralized application based on Ethereum that facilitates transparent and secure reservations and deposit handling between customers and business owners.

Main Objective: To enable customers and business owners to manage reservations directly without the intervention of a central server, particularly providing transparency in transactions and enhancing security. The aim is to overcome the complexity and inefficiency of traditional Web 2.0 reservation systems, protect users' personal information, and simplify the reservation and payment process.

Project Description:
Track Book is a decentralized application based on Ethereum blockchain, aiding customers and business owners in managing reservations and securely handling deposits. Users sign up using only MetaMask or Binance wallets, and this information is hashed and recorded on the blockchain to verify the user's identity. This approach reduces the risk of personal data leaks and complicated identity verification procedures that can occur in traditional Web 2.0 reservation systems.

Our smart contract only records transactions related to deposits on the chain, effectively managing issues such as gas fees and processing speed while ensuring transparency. Other details, such as reservation specifics, are managed on the server to enhance efficiency and user experience.

Track Book also offers an automatic deposit handling feature through smart contracts, simplifying traditional payment and refund procedures and effectively addressing the issue of reservation no-shows. Customers directly transfer the deposit to the smart contract, and business owners can receive the deposit once the reservation is confirmed.

Track Book utilizes a QR code-based reservation verification method. The users generate a QR code based on their hashed information and the reservation ID received from the server and present it to the business owner. The business owner can scan this QR code to verify the reservation information and receive the deposit through the smart contract. This method is fast and convenient while protecting the user's personal information and reducing the risk of reservation no-shows for the business owner.

In this way, Track Book strives to enhance the transparency of the reservation system, protect users' personal information, and improve the overall user experience using blockchain technology. Our goal is to simplify the reservation and payment process and build trust between business owners and customers. Through this, Track Book can overcome the shortcomings of traditional centralized reservation systems and provide a safer and more convenient reservation experience for users.
